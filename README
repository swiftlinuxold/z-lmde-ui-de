This is the repository that installs and configures IceWM and ROX pinboard, the same lightweight window manager and
desktop environment used in antiX Linux.  This repository also installs and configures Conky.

IceWM looks and feels more like GNOME 2, Xfce, and Windows 95/98/XP than Fluxbox does.

IceWM is easier to configure than JWM and has more support available.

ROX pinboard offers the clickable icons on the desktop like GNOME 2, Xfce, and LXDE but is lighter and faster.
