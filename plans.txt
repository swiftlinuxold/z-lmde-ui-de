The antiX Linux user interface is easier to emulate than the Puppy Linux user interface.

However, Puppy Linux has a better menu.  

Future plans are to modify the menu files and menu updating script to behave more like Puppy Linux.
Puppy Linux with IceWM installed and activated will be a model for this.
